Hello! I am Wang Ma (È©¨Êó∫), an incoming Ph.D student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/)), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qiang Ji](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~qji/). I obtained my B.S. in Data Science from Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/)) in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Wang](https://wangcmath.github.io/). During the Spring of 2023, I was an exchange student at UC Irvine and a visitor at [Prof. Hengrui Cai](https://hengruicai.github.io/)'s group.


<br/>

I am broadly interested in Optimization, Probabilistic Machine Learning and Deep Learning Theory.

# ‚öæ More

* **Baseball**. I enjoy watching NPB games and the Japan High School Tournament, Koshien. My favorite NPB team is [*<font color=Blue>Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters</font>*](https://www.fighters.co.jp/), where Shohei Ohtani started his professional career in 2013. I am also a super fan of Ohmi High School, the baseball rising-star school from Shiga Prefecture in Japan, see the highlights of Ohmi High School [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bF411a7B4/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=39c9e2f0249c14d448a63ad2dec02137), their blue uniforms shine brighter than the sky in August.

* I am a **speedcuber** who participated in more than 20 official games with Square-1 being my best event. My ranking in Square-1 Event is No.2 in mainland China now (Mar. 2023), and I got **2 Bronze Medals in National Championship** in 2017 & 2018, respectively. You can watch some recordings of my solves in my [Bilibili Channel](https://space.bilibili.com/237775327/video). To see all my results in official games, please take a look at my [WCA page](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016MAWA01). I devoted myself to practicing the Rubik‚Äôs Cube during my high school time and the first year of University. In May 2021, I improved my personal best record on the Square-1 cube and [ranked No.2 in mainland China](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/sq1/average?region=China). With this experience of fighting for the things I love, I am confident that I will carry on this perseverance in the research I love in the future!

* **Anime**. My favorite short anime is *Spice and Wolf*, while my preferred long anime is *One Piece*. I have been watching *One Piece* since I was 8 years old, and watched the latest movie version on the first day it released in mainland China. Additionally, I enjoy Chinese Anime such as Ë∂ÖÂÖΩÊ≠¶Ë£Ö, ÊûúÂÆùÁâπÊîª, Ê¥õÊ¥õÂéÜÈô©ËÆ∞, ÊòüÊ∏∏ËÆ∞ and would be happy to discuss them with you!

* My hometown is Baoji, Shaanxi Province, which is the center of Acient China for the most of the past. I like reading **history** about here, especially the *Pre-Qin History*, the Warring States period of the Hundred Schools of Thought (ÁôæÂÆ∂‰∫âÈ∏£ÁöÑÊàòÂõΩÊó∂‰ª£).
