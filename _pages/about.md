Hello! I am Wang Ma (é©¬æ—º), an incoming Ph.D student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/)), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qiang Ji](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~qji/). I obtained my B.S. in Data Science from Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/)) in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Wang](https://wangcmath.github.io/). During the Spring of 2023, I was an exchange student at UC Irvine and a visitor at [Prof. Hengrui Cai](https://hengruicai.github.io/)'s group.


<br/>

I am broadly interested in Optimization, Probabilistic Machine Learning and Deep Learning Theory.
