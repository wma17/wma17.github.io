Hello, I am Wang Ma (马旺), a second-year Ph.D student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/)) advised by [Prof. Qiang Ji](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~qji/). Before coming to RPI, I obtained my B.S. from Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/)), advised by [Prof. Chao Wang](https://wangcmath.github.io/). 


<br/>

I have a broad interest in Uncertainty Quantification, Bayesian Deep Learning and their applications to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Recently, my focus is specifically Uncertainty Quantification and Uncertainty Disentanglement for single models and pre-trained models (such as pre-trained large vision or language models), and Knowledge-augmented Bayesian Deep Learning.

# ⚾ More

* **Baseball**  I’m a passionate fan of **MLB**, **NPB**, and Japan’s **National High School Baseball Tournament (Koshien)**.  My favorite NPB team is [*Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters*](https://www.fighters.co.jp/), where **Shohei Ohtani** began his professional career in 2013.   I’m also a big supporter of **Ōmi High School**, a rising baseball powerhouse from **Shiga Prefecture**. You can check out some of their highlights [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bF411a7B4/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=39c9e2f0249c14d448a63ad2dec02137)—their blue uniforms shine brighter than the August sky.  

  * I led a project analyzing **MLB Statcast data** in my undergraduate *Data Science Project* course.  [Slides](https://wma17.github.io/_pages/BaseballAnalysis_slides.pdf),[Report](https://wma17.github.io/_pages/BaseballAnalysis_report.pdf)

* I am a **speedcuber** who has participated in over 30 official competitions, with **Square-1** being my best event. I am currently **ranked No. 3 in mainland China** (as of Nov 2025) and earned **two bronze medals at the Chinese National Championships** in 2017 and 2018.  You can find recordings of my solves on my [Bilibili channel](https://space.bilibili.com/237775327/video), and view all my official results on my [WCA profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016MAWA01).  I devoted much of my high school and early university years to Rubik’s Cube practice. In May 2021, I achieved my personal best in the Square-1 event and [reached No. 2 in mainland China](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/sq1/single?region=China).  Through years of pursuing something I truly love, I’ve learned perseverance — a quality I now bring into my research with the same passion and dedication.

<!-- * **Anime**. My favorite short anime is *Spice and Wolf*, while my preferred long anime is *One Piece*. I have been watching *One Piece* since I was 8 years old, and watched the latest movie version on the first day it released in mainland China. Additionally, I enjoy Chinese Anime such as 超兽武装, 果宝特攻, 洛洛历险记, 星游记 and would be happy to discuss them with anyone! -->

* I’m from Baoji, Shaanxi Province, a region that served as the heart of ancient China for much of its history. I enjoy reading about its rich past, especially the *Pre-Qin* era and the vibrant *Warring States period*, known for the flourishing of the Hundred Schools of Thought<!-- (百家争鸣的战国时代)-->.
