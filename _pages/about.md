Hello! I am Wang Ma (È©¨Êó∫), a third-year undergraduate in Data Science at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/), under the supervise of [Prof. Chao Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/cwang). I will be in UC Irvine in late March as a visiting student.


<br/>
I am generally interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision(Deep Learning), Optimization and Statistics. 


<br/>
I have completed serval courses on Statistics, Machine Learning and Optimization(including a graduate-level one) in SUSTech, lately I've been paying special attention to AIGC models, especially diffusion models and Text-to-Image models.


<br/>
I devoted myself to practicing the Rubik's Cube during the first year of University. In May 2021, I improved my personal best record on the Square-1 cube and [ranked No.2 in mainland China](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/sq1/average?region=China). With this experience of fighting for the things I love, I am confident that I will carry on this perseverance in the research I love in the future.

<br/>

# ‚öæ More
* **Baseball**. I enjoy watching NPB games and the Japan High School Tournament, Koshien. My favorite NPB team is *<font color=Blue>Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters</font>*, where Shohei Otani started his professional career. I am also a super fan of Ohmi High School, the baseball rising-star school from Shiga Prefecture in Japan, see the highlights of Ohmi High School [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bF411a7B4/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=39c9e2f0249c14d448a63ad2dec02137), their blue uniforms shine brighter than the sky in August.

* I am a **speedcuber** who participated in more than 20 official games with Square-1 being my best event. My ranking in Square-1 Event is No.2 in mainland China now (Mar. 2023), and I got 2 **Bronze Medals from the National Championship** in 2017, 2018. You can watch some recordings of my solves in my [Bilibili Channel](https://space.bilibili.com/237775327/video). To see all my results in official games, please take a look at my [WCA page](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016MAWA01).

* **Anime**. My favorite short anime is *Spice and Wolf*, while my preferred long anime is *One Piece*. I have been watching *One Piece* since I was 8 years old, and watched the latest movie version on the first day it released in mainland China. Additionally, I enjoy Chinese Anime such as Ë∂ÖÂÖΩÊ≠¶Ë£Ö, ÊûúÂÆùÁâπÊîª, Ê¥õÊ¥õÂéÜÈô©ËÆ∞, ÊòüÊ∏∏ËÆ∞ and would be happy to discuss them with you!

* My hometown is Baoji, Shaanxi Province, which is the center of Acient China for the most of the past. I like reading **history** about here, especially the *Pre-Qin History*, the Warring States period of the Hundred Schools of Thought (ÁôæÂÆ∂‰∫âÈ∏£ÁöÑÊàòÂõΩÊó∂‰ª£).
